oVirt Script Engine Gateway Extension
=====================================

This extension enables implementation of extensions using Java
Script Engine technology.

The actual implementation is derived from the script engine
requirements, but basically, a construction function returns
object instance of Extension interface.

Example of JavaScript engine is:

    function MyExtension() {}
    MyExtension.prototype = {
    invoke: function(input, output) {
    },
    };
    function create() {
        return new MyExtension();
    }

STATUS
------

Due to JBoss modules handling of class path the javascript engine (at least)
does not work as it cannot find a common class loader for both ScriptObject
and the application objects that should be exposed via the script engine.

  TypeError: Can not find a common class loader for ScriptObject and XXX

This is inherit issue within jboss modules, as every module has its own
class loader. A union class loader does not provide remedy as the actual
class loader of various of classes remains the original one.

Workaround can be applied by:
1. adding all classes that are to be exposed into boot classpath.
2. use reflection to query script objects/interfaces.

Both are unacceptable for maintaining a component.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
--------------------

INTEGERS

Make sure to use the Java native integer and not script engine
number type. This can be done by calling java.lang.Integer.valueOf(v).

CONFIGURATION
-------------

/etc/ovirt-enigne/extensions.d/<name>.conf

ovirt.engine.extension.name = @NAME@
ovirt.engine.extension.bindings.method = jbossmodule
ovirt.engine.extension.binding.jbossmodule.module = org.ovirt.engine-extensions.script-engine
ovirt.engine.extension.binding.jbossmodule.class = org.ovirt.engineextensions.scriptengine.ScriptEngineExtension
config.scriptengine.engine = @ENGINE@ [JavaScript]
config.scriptengine.script.@SCRIPTID@ = @SCRIPTPATH@
config.scriptengine.function = @CREATEFUNC@ [create]

@NAME@
    Extension instance name.

@ENGINE@
    Script Engine name.
    Default: JavaScript.

@SCRIPTID@
    Id of script, scripts are loaded into same engine by the order of
    script id.

@SCRIPTPATH@
    Script file name.
    System properties expansion is supported at the form of ${property}.

@CREATEFUNC@
    Create function name.
    Called during initialization to create the extension instance.
    Default: create
